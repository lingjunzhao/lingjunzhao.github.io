I am a 4th-year Ph.D. student at the Computer Science Department of University of Maryland, College Park, where I am advised by Prof. Hal Daum√© III. I graduated from Columbia University with M.S. in Computer Science, and Sun Yat-Sen University with B.S. in Computational Mathematics.

I am broadly interested in studying problems related to **trustworthiness** in **multimodal** setting, aiming to enhance **human-AI collaboration**. My research focuses on equipping visual-language models with self-reasoning and self-improvement capabilities to better serve human needs. This includes (i) detecting and correcting hallucinations, (ii) generating faithful explanations, (iii) fostering pragmatic understanding and (iv) temporal understanding.

I am interested in research internship in 2025.
