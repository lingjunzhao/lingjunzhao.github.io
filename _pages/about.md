I am a third-year Ph.D. student at the Computer Science Department of University of Maryland, College Park, where I am advised by Prof. Hal Daum√© III. I am interested in human-AI collaboration, and am excited about topics including multimodal learning, trustworthiness and cognitive-motivated modeling.

I graduated from Columbia University with M.S. in Computer Science, and Sun Yat-Sen University with B.S. in Computational Mathematics. Before joining UMD, I worked on low resource cross-lingual information retrieval, information extraction and computer vision.
