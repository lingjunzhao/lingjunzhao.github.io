I am a 5th-year Ph.D. student at the Computer Science Department of University of Maryland, College Park, where I am advised by Prof. Hal Daum√© III. I graduated from Columbia University with M.S. in Computer Science, and Sun Yat-Sen University with B.S. in Computational Mathematics.

I am broadly interested in studying problems related to **trustworthiness** in **multimodal** setting, aiming to enhance **human-centered AI**. My research focuses on equipping visual-language models with self-reasoning and self-improvement capabilities to better serve human needs. This includes:\
(i) Correcting hallucinations and communicating uncertainties  
(ii) Fostering pragmatic understanding by simulating human behavior  
(iii) Generating faithful explanations  
(iv) Visual-language alignment for long context
